 A spritekite based app that creates bordering triangles, assigns them either red, white, yellow, blue, green, or black. The point of the program is to use least amount of colors possible; bordering triangles cannot be assigned the same color. Basically a visual representation of basic Graph theory in discrete mathematics.
