# 30 Day App Challenge
This challenge was inspired by Gareth Jones's Medium article (https://medium.com/@gpj/30-apps-in-30-days-6686a570e90) where he created a mobile app everyday for a month. I wanted to challenge myself to improve my iOS development skills and do the same thing, so I'm going to be making an app everyday in the month of March 2019.

2. Re-use as little code as possible 
3. No storyboards: everything must be 100% in code
3. Commit MVP of each app to GitHub by 11:59PM each day
4. Rinse & Repeat

## Day 1: Random Color Generator 
An app that gives users random colors when they shake their device; displays the color, hex value, and RGB value. ~Also allows users to store their favorite colors for later use.~

## Day 2: Speed Limit Checker
An app that checks if user is going speed limit and alerts them if they are speeding by changing color of background. Only works on VA streets because the way the data parsing is set up, it only checks speed aganist VA laws. I was not able to find a free API to check speed limits everywhere.
