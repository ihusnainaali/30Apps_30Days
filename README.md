# 30 Day App Challenge
This challenge was inspired by Gareth Jones's Medium article (https://medium.com/@gpj/30-apps-in-30-days-6686a570e90) where he created a mobile app everyday for a month. I wanted to challenge myself to improve my iOS development skills and do the same thing, so I'm going to be making an app everyday in the month of March 2019.

## Rules
1. Fresh Xcode Project created after 12AM of each day 
2. Re-use as little code as possible 
3. No storyboards: everything must be 100% in code
3. Commit MVP of each app to GitHub by 11:59PM each day
4. Rinse & Repeat

## Lines of Code Written So Far This Month: 
```
1243

## Day 1: Random Color Generator 
An app that gives users random colors when they shake their device; displays the color, hex value, and RGB value. ~Also allows users to store their favorite colors for later use.~

## Day 2: Speed Limit Checker
An app that checks if user is going speed limit and alerts them if they are speeding by changing color of background. Only works on VA streets because the way the data parsing is set up, it only checks speed aganist VA laws. I was not able to find a free API to check speed limits everywhere.

## Day 3: SSH Shell
An app that allows the user to open an SSH shell, using the NMSSH library. This app is really just a proof of concept because it can sucessfully open a shell but is quite buggy: users have to enter credentials in the XCode workspace, the shell freezes a lot, and the text formatting is all over the place. I had a lot of school stuff to finish today so I wasn't able to perfect it completely, but still a cool app regardless.

## Day 4: Study App (Pomodoro Technique) 
An app aimed at helping users study better, based on the Pomodoro technique. Not only acts as a study timer, but also forces users to enable airplane mode to focus. 

## App Ideas TO_DO 
- [ ] Text to speech app 
- [ ] Raspberry PI App 
- [ ] App to connect to Deauth hardware I have 
- [ ] Snow day chance calculator
